# Loan Analysis using Scatter Chart and Linear Regression

This GitHub repository presents an analysis of loan data using Python to create a scatter chart with a linear trendline for monthly income versus loan amount. The project also includes the derivation of a regression model and predictions based on given data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze loan data using Python and visualize the relationship between monthly income and loan amount through a scatter chart. Additionally, a linear trendline is added to capture the trend in the data. The regression model is derived from the trendline, and predictions are made based on this model.

## Key Features

- Utilized Python for data analysis and visualization.
- Created a scatter chart to illustrate the relationship between monthly income and loan amount.
- Added a linear trendline to the scatter chart for trend identification.
- Derived a regression model from the trendline to predict loan amounts.
- Demonstrated the process of analyzing data, visualizing trends, and making predictions using Python.

## Setup

To replicate the project and visualize the loan data:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with relevant libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib).
3. Load and preprocess the loan data from the provided Excel file.
4. Use Python to create the scatter chart with a linear trendline.
5. Derive the regression model from the trendline and make predictions.

## Usage

1. Load the loan data using Pandas.
2. Utilize Matplotlib to create the scatter chart and add a linear trendline.
3. Analyze the trendline equation to derive the regression model.
4. Make predictions based on the regression model.
5. Customize and enhance the analysis as needed.
